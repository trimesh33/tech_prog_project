# DnD proj

Now there is no way to run code with cmake & make, but it'll be added.

# Description
DnD isometric game, based on text-based, but game with graphics.

## Structure
In the game u have several not match option: walk throw map and find escape doing quests along the way and sometimes fighting with monsters (fights are based on your spells, that u acquire while walk through, and their damage varies from dices)

(This project base on my previous graphics project with added game logic)
## Implementation
Used pattens:
- Model-View-Controller
- Builder for Spells (in progress)
- Strategy pattern for units, that behave the same
